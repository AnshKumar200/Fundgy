# Fundgy
Fundgy, a decentralized crowdfunding app, empowers users to raise funds directly for their projects, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Born from the frustration of witnessing great projects fail due to funding gaps, Fundgy aims to democratize and redefine crowdfunding for a more inclusive experience.
